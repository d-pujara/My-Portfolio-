 ### [Tweets Climate Change Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/d-pujara/my_portfolio/tree/main/twitter_sentiment_analysis)
 
With climate change being a widespread global challenge, it has become increasingly important to filter information that is deseminated to the wider public for accuracy to avoid any disinformation. For many, Twitter has become a priamry outlet for news and tweets with misinformation on climate change not being a man-made phenomenon can quickly spread however fragmented and inconsitent it may be. 

This sentiment analysis model breaks down the individual words that lie within a tweet using tokenization, stemming, and vectorizatioon methoods. The developed model than assimilates words into vectoried quantities that give weights in phrases that lead to a specific sentiment. 

-1 : Climate change is not a man-made phenomenon and is a hoax. 
0 : Neutral opinion 
1: Climate change is a man-made phenomenon and is very real.
2: Factual news story

Model has been trained with 74% accuracy.

### [Liver Cirrhosis Predictive Algorithm]()

Alcohol since its conception in China 7000 BCe using fermented rice, honey and hawthorn fruit, has been both an advera . An adverse impact of excessive alcohol consumption can be the development of Liver Cirrhosis. This predictive model takes into account various features regarding the body and outputs a prediction for the patient's current stage of cirrhosis development.
