 ##### [Tweets Climate Change Sentiment Analysis]()
 
With Climate Change being one of the most significant challenges we face globally, it has become increasingly important to filter information that is deseminated to the wider public. For many, Twitter has become an outlet for news and can quickly spread although the information is fragmented and in some cases not factual. This sentiment analysis model breaks down the individual words reported in a tweet and employs a tokeniaation method to inidcate whether the tweet is spreading falsehhoods or if the tweet can be trusted.
