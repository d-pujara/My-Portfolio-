# Portfolio Projects

This repository contains a coollection of a few machine learning and deep learning projects I have developed. Projects have all been developed using Python, Node.js and the deployed projects were developed using Flask and Heroku. Tech kits used -- tensorFlow, sci-kit, pytorch, opencv.

 ### [Tweets Climate Change Sentiment Analysis](https://github.com/d-pujara/my_portfolio/tree/main/twitter_sentiment_analysis)
 
With climate change being a widespread global challenge, it has become increasingly important to filter information that is deseminated to the wider public for accuracy to avoid any disinformation. For many, Twitter has become a priamry outlet for news and tweets with misinformation on climate change not being a man-made phenomenon can quickly spread however fragmented and inconsitent it may be. 

This sentiment analysis model breaks down the individual words that lie within a tweet using tokenization, stemming, and vectorizatioon methoods. The developed model than assimilates words into vectoried quantities that give weights in phrases that lead to a specific sentiment. 

- -1 : Climate change is not a man-made phenomenon and is a hoax. 
- 0 : Neutral opinion 
- 1: Climate change is a man-made phenomenon and is very real.
- 2: Factual news story

Model has been trained with 74% accuracy.

### [Liver Cirrhosis Predictive Algorithm]()

Liver Cirrhosis . An adverse impact of excessive alcohol consumption can be the development of Liver Cirrhosis. Having had family members who have been diagnosed with liver cirrhosis following decades of unhealthy levels of alcohol consumptioon, I believe that liver cirrhosis needs to be diagnosed as early as possible. 

This predictive model takes into account various features regarding the body and outputs a prediction for the patient's current stage of cirrhosis development.

| Feature Variable | Description | Average Values | 
| --- | --- | --- |
| `N-Days` | List all *new or modified* files | |
| `Status` |  |
| `Drug` |  |
| `Sex` | Male or Female |  |
| `Ascites` | |  |
| `Hepatomegaly` | |  |
| `Spiders` | |  |

### [Real Estate and Mortgage Expenses Analytics for Loan Demand Prediction ]()

Banking institutions requires actionable insights into mortgage-backed securities, geographic business investment, and real estate analysis to make predictions on the demand for region-based loans. This hypothetical mortgage bank would like to identify potential monthly mortgage expenses for each region based on monthly family income and rental of the real estate. 

The prediction model was trained using a multi-variate linear regression algorithm and can predict the potential demand in dollars amount of loan for each of the region in the USA. I have also created a dashboard to display the data using Tableau.
